# 🧠 Medical Drug Test – Neural Network Model

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **educational Neural Network (NN) model** built to simulate a **medical drug testing scenario**.  
It is designed **purely for learning purposes** and demonstrates the **fundamentals of creating, training, validating, and testing a neural network** using a simplified medical-style dataset.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**:  
> This project is **not intended for real-world medical use**.  
> It is a **toy/example model** created to understand neural network concepts only.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Understand the **basic structure of a Neural Network**
- Learn how to:
  - Prepare and preprocess data
  - Build a neural network model
  - Train the model
  - Validate performance
  - Test and evaluate results
- Gain hands-on experience with **model evaluation metrics**

---

## 🧪 Problem Description (Example Scenario)
The model predicts whether a **drug is effective or not** based on simulated patient features such as:
- Age
- Dosage level
- Biomarker values
- Physiological indicators (simulated)

The output is a **binary classification**:
- `1` → Drug effective  
- `0` → Drug not effective

## 🧠 Neural Network Concepts Covered
- Artificial Neurons
- Input, Hidden, and Output layers
- Activation functions
- Loss functions
- Backpropagation
- Gradient descent
- Overfitting & underfitting
- Training vs Validation vs Testing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Jupyter notebook**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (visualization)
- **TensorFlow / Keras** *(or PyTorch – depending on implementation)*
